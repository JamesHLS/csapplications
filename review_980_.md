#HTML and CSS Syntax [Very Good]
- index.html
  - No Doctype at start of HTML
  - Missing language in HTML tag
  - Style tag was inside HTML body, should be in the head
  - Stray section end tag on line 212
- aaron.html
  - no issues
- jacky.html
  - Stray closing div tag, line 121
  - Style tag was inside HTML body, should be in the head. Line 221
- rafi.html
  - Closed tags in wrong order (p and em tags). Lines 127-130
  - Style tag was inside HTML body, should be in the head. Line 272

- style.css
  - no issues

- Mostly very good HTML syntax with the website as a whole working. Main issues lie in copying the same style content that is in the body across all the pages (Should be in style.css).
